Small air showers in IceTop
IceTop is an air shower array that is part of the IceCube Observatory currently under construction at the geographic South Pole. When completed, it will consist of 80 stations covering an area of 1 km2. Previous analyzes done with IceTop studied the events that triggered five or more stations, leading to an effective energy threshold of about 0.5 PeV. The goal of this study is to push this threshold lower, into the region where it will overlap with direct measurements of cosmic rays which currently have an upper limit around 300TeV.We select showers that trigger exactly three or exactly four adjacent surface stations that are not on the periphery of the detector (contained events). This extends the energy threshold down to 150TeV.
