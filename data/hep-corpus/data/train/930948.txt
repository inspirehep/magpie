Open Charm Measurement in p+p $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV Collisions at STAR
The charm production is sensitive to early dynamics of the created system in RHIC heavy ion collisions. Dominant process of charm quarks production at RHIC is believed to be initial gluon fusion which can be calculated in the perturbative QCD. Understanding both the charm production total cross section and the fragmentation in p+p collisions is a baseline to further exploring the QCD medium via open charm and charmonium in heavy ion collisions. In this paper we present the first reconstruction of open charm meson $D^{0}$ via the weak decay to K and $\pi$ mesons in the p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. The analysis is based on the large p+p minimum bias sample collected in RHIC year 2009 by the STAR detector. The $D^0$ decay daughter identification was improved by using the data of the newly installed Time-Of-Flight detector with 72% of its designed coverage.
