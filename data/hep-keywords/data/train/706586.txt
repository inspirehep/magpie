From AdS(3)/CFT(2) to black holes/topological strings
The elliptic genus Z_{BH} of a large class of 4D black holes can be expressed as an M-theory partition function on an AdS_3xS^2xCY_3 attractor. We approximate this partition function by summing over multiparticle chiral primary states of membranes which wrap curves in the CY_3 and tile Landau levels on the horizon S^2. Significantly, membranes and antimembranes can preserve the same supercharges if they occupy antipodal points on the horizon. It is shown the membrane contribution to Z_{BH} gives precisely the topological string partition function Z_{top} while the antimembranes give \bar Z_{top}, implying Z_{BH}=|Z_{top}|^2 in this approximation.
