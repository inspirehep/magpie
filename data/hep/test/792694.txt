Stochastic Quantization of Scalar Fields in de Sitter Spacetime
We consider the stochastic quantization method for scalar fields defined in a curved manifold. The two-point function associated to a massive self-interacting scalar field is evaluated, up to the first order level in the coupling constant $\lambda$, for the case of de Sitter Euclidean metric. Its value for the asymptotic limit of the Markov parameter $\tau\to\infty$ is exhibited. We discuss in detail the covariant stochastic regularization to render the one-loop two-point function finite in the de Sitter Euclidean metric.
